# CREDITS & SHOUTOUT
Credit's to Den on Stackoverflow, who did the Main Work on this Component.

I did some beauty modifications that I think are awesome.  
You can define the minimum and maximum value in the call paramters  
You can also define the steps that the value changes when you move the button  



# FINAL WORDS
This is my first package which I intend to use again myself, because I think
it is much better than the SwiftUI Slider Component.
There is however the UIKit Slider Component which seems to be better,
but I generally refuse to learn Legacy Code.
